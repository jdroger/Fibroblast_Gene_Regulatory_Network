# Fibroblast Gene Regulatory Network Inference

Scripts infer networks of transcriptional regulation from gene expression data using the GRNBoost2 algorithm. Original networks are refined to match annotated transcription factor (TF)-target databases as well as genes related to cardiac fibrosis. Additional capabilities include k-fold cross validation and conversion to a database for dynamic simulation using Netflux.
